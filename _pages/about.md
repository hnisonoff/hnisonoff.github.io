# About Me

I am a PhD student in [Computational Biology](https://ccb.berkeley.edu) at University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Jennifer Listgarten](http://www.jennifer.listgarten.com) and a member of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab [(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu). My research focuses on developing machine learning methods for protein design and drug discovery, with a particular emphasis on combining biophysics-based knowledge with modern deep learning approaches.

## Background

Prior to Berkeley, I worked at [D. E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com) where I conducted drug discovery research using long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning.

I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Duke University, where I worked with [Bruce Donald](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~brd/home.html) on improved algorithms for computational structure-based protein design. 

## Recent Work

My recent work includes:
- Developing methods for guidance in discrete state-space diffusion models in molecular design
- Creating approaches for coherent blending of biophysics-based knowledge with Bayesian neural networks
- Contributing to projects on RNA language models and protein fitness prediction
