# About Me

I am a PhD student in [Computational Biology](https://ccb.berkeley.edu) at University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Jennifer Listgarten](http://www.jennifer.listgarten.com) and a member of the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab [(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu). My research focuses on developing machine learning methods for protein design and drug discovery, with a particular emphasis on combining biophysics-based knowledge with modern deep learning approaches.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning for Protein Design**: Developing novel methods that combine biophysical knowledge with deep learning to predict and optimize protein properties
- **Drug Discovery**: Creating computational approaches for small molecule design and optimization
- **Computational Biology**: Working on various problems at the intersection of machine learning and biological sciences

## Background

Prior to Berkeley, I worked at [D. E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com) where I conducted research on machine learning-based approaches for designing small molecules. I developed methods to facilitate drug discovery by creating better representations of chemical space and improving molecular optimization techniques.

I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Duke University, where I worked with [Bruce Donald](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~brd/home.html) on improved algorithms for computational structure-based protein design. My undergraduate research focused on developing efficient algorithms for partition function estimation in protein design.

## Recent Work

My recent work includes:
- Developing methods for discrete state-space diffusion models in molecular design
- Creating approaches for coherent blending of biophysics-based knowledge with Bayesian neural networks
- Contributing to projects on RNA language models and protein fitness prediction
- Collaborating on various interdisciplinary projects combining machine learning with experimental biology
