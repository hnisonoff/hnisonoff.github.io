# About Me
I am a PhD student in [Computational Biology](https://ccb.berkeley.edu) at University of California, Berkeley advised by [Jennifer Listgarten](http://www.jennifer.listgarten.com) and a member of the Berkeley Artifical Intelligence Research Lab [(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu). Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked at [D. E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com) where I conducted research on machine learning-based approaches for designing small-molecules. I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Duke Universit, where I worked with [Bruce Donald](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~brd/home.html) on improved algorithms for computational structure-based protein design.
