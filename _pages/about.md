# About Me
I am a PhD student in [Computational Biology](https://ccb.berkeley.edu) at University of California, Berkeley advised by [Jennifer Listgarten](http://www.jennifer.listgarten.com) and a member of the Berkeley Artifical Intelligence Research Lab [(BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu). Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked at [D. E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com) where I conducted research on machine learning-based approaches to designing small-molecules. I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from Duke University University, where I was worked with Bruce Donald on improved algorithms for computational structure-based protein design.
